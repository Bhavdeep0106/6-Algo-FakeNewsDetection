# Comparative-Analysis-of-Algorithms-for-identifying-false-news
False news is a problem that has grown significantly in the current digital era. Consequently, with the widespread use of social media for content dissemination, it is common to discover false and altered material that is disseminated there. A major negative effect on people and society could result from the widespread dissemination of erroneous information. It is preferable to analyze the social reactions to a piece in addition to its literary elements when determining if it is real or fake. For a particular dataset, the literacy algorithms are trained with a variety of hyperparameters to reach the highest level of delicacy. The spread of false information has led to a growing need for accurate and efficient methods to detect it. This study used machine learning algorithms to estimate how accurate fake news would be. The algorithms were trained and tested using a dataset of diverse news stories that had been classified as fake or genuine. Different machine learning models' efficacy was evaluated, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes and more. By detecting and filtering out fake news, the credibility of news sources can be maintained, the spread of misinformation can be prevented, harmful consequences can be avoided, healthy discourse can be promoted, and democracy can be protected.
